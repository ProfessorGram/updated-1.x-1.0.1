## Administrative GUI Visibility
The day, date and time of the last time a node was updated always appears as a read-only field appearing in the "Authoring information" section of the node edit form.

## User GUI Visibility
Whether or not text representing the day, date and time of the last node update appears in the User GUI is controlled via a checkbox located in the "Publishing options" section of the node edit form.  Through this mechanism, it is possible to selectively expose node update information on a node-by-node basis.
